# Vermintide2
A Java program to test item level progression in the video game Vermintide 2.
All that is included is a Main.java file that will run in any version of Java at or above Java 8.

Notably, this implementation assumes uniformly distributed item levels, which is not the case ingame. Since I lack the info to make this more accurate, I will not solve this issue.
